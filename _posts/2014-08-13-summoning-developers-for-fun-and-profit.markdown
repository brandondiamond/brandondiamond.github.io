title: "Summoning Developers (For Fun and Profit)"
---

I've worn many hats in my day&mdash; and that's not just because of male pattern baldness. Well, not entirely.

As a techie about town, I've done everything from [rallying](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/techies-plan-to-take-sopa-protest-to-the-streets/) fellow hackers to [evangelizing](http://mongodb.com) database software and yes, I've even spent some time writing [code](http://huffingtonpost.com/code).

Over the course of my adventures, I've often run into folks who are looking to engage the developer community. Many seek their (one true) tech co-founder. Others just want to hire some darn good engineers.

To these folks, I've typically offered the same advice: contribute to the engineering community and you'll meet awesome techies along the way. Give back to the community and the community will give back to you.

This, plus or minus a snarky tweet, has been the extent of what I've written on the topic.

Last year, however, I found the shoe on the other foot: I needed to build an awesome team of generalist hackers (like [Wenting](http://wentin.co) and [Jesse](http://toomanybees.com) and [Cedric](http://vvvnt.com)).

In so doing, I've amassed something of an "evangelism playbook"&mdash; a collection of strategies that have helped me build a terrific team while also giving back to the engineering community.

I've written many of these strategies down in the hopes of eventually sharing them publically&hellip; but immediately became obsessed with drones and forgot to actually publish anything (sorry). That, of course, is about to change&mdash; though I still think drones are freakin' *awesome*.

Over the course of the next few months, I'll be posting 2 to 3 of these write-ups every week. If you're someone that'd like to engage the engineering community, hopefully you'll find these posts helpful. If not, hopefully you'll spend your time reading something cool like Dune or Snowcrash.

I'll be tweeting each of these posts via [@brandondiamond](http://twitter.com/brandondiamond) so please follow to stay in the loop (*/shameless self-promotion*).  The first few posts'll be coming out later this week.
