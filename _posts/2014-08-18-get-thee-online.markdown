## Forward

Let's start simply.

If you Google (or Bing, as the case may be) your product / company / identity, what do you find? Does your Pinterest profile show up? Maybe a blog post you wrote about Pokemon? Perhaps an embarassing OkCupid photo?

The first and best way to engage the developer community is to *meet 'em where they are*: online.

We'll talk about meetups and lectures and conferences soon enough. For now, keep the barrier to learning about you as low as possible and *focus, focus, focus*.


## Summary

A single comprehensive website that aggregates and showcases your content (Twitter, Facebook, github), culture (photos, videos, media), and information (jobs, APIs, blog posts).

## Rationale

A well organized website (with an appropriately authentic design) will tie together evangelism efforts and showcase the innovation culture you're building. By emphasizing creativity, style, and experimentation, your website will help inform the tech community and provide a central point from which to focus your outreach.

## Discussion

There can be only one (&hellip; cannonical home page). Traffic should be funneled to the website via all social channels and vice versa. The website should present material of genuine interest to the tech community, demonstrate creativity / hacker attitudes (i.e., use new frontend tech, be silly, show off open source contributions), feature engaging media, and present projects and experiments. A strong community element is desirable (i.e., integration with Meetup, events calendars, and partner organizations).

## Risks and Cost

Requires designer and frontend engineer as well as ongoing maintenance by an admin. Primary risk is that website will not receive significant attention.
