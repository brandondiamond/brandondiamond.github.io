Startups are really good at two things: moving quickly and making mistakes.

The best startups are run by people who study their mistakes and [iterate often](https://www.leanstartupmachine.com/). Failure isn't just a possibility: it's a requirement. Can big companies do that, too? Can a behemoth like [Viacom](http://viacom.com) or [Aol](http://aol.com) or even [Hyatt Hotels](http://ariegoldshlager.wordpress.com/2013/07/22/hyatt-transforms-nine-hotels-into-inovation-labs/) throw caution to the wind and build cool shit? Sorta.

For the past two years, I've helped launch and direct an embedded innovation lab called (uninventively enough) [HuffPost Labs](https://github.com/huffpostlabs). HuffPost, for those unfamiliar with the gory details, was acquired by Aol in 2011. This, in addition to several other things, helped turn HuffPost into a Matryoshka doll of corporate politics and, shall we say, shenanigans.

In the years that followed, HuffPost would acquire a young, clever, and idealistic startup named [Localocracy](http://localocracy.com), itself founded by the young, clever, and idealistic Conor White-Sullivan. Once aboard the mothership, Conor did what entrepreneurs do best and set out to shake things up&mdash; which is how we met.

Together, Conor and I formulated what we thought would be the "right" structure for an innovation team. We made a lot of decisions. Many of them were silly.

Unbeknownst to us, our greatest challenge wouldn't be building an engine capable of producing "the future of media". Neither would it be designing an awesome dev methodology. Heck, it wouldn't even be hiring engineers.

The challenge of doing innovation at work, it turns out, is much more than the innovation. In fact, the innovation&mdash; when you actually get to do it&mdash; is the cherry on top.

As a result, over the course of its 2-3 years, HuffPost Labs has gone through many iterations. Some of these good, others bad. Throughout, we've proven (and then some) [Oliver Emberton](http://oliveremberton.com/2014/if-youre-not-pissing-someone-off-you-probably-arent-doing-anything-important/)'s excellent thesis:

> If you're not pissing someone off, you probably aren't doing anything important.

In the end, though politics bested us in many ways, we were successful in building a strategy for innovating at work. The solution turned out to be as elegant as it was obvious: though occasionally, the best practice turned out to be what you'd least expect.

Encouraging innovation is an incredibly important goal for companies large and small. Unfortunately, most companies totally suck at innovation. And change. And critcism.

As a result, many large companies are stuck in a holding pattern of suckiness and will, in all likelihood, eventually find themselves trapped beneath the heel of a 16-year old wunderkind with a penchant for data structures and disruption.

The stories we wrote at Labs were at times amusing, challenging, and inspiring. Though Labs has since been scattered amongst the stars (Viacom, Facebook, Bloomberg, HuffPost, and various startups), the methods we developed and our understanding of "intrapreneurship", I believe, remains quite valuable.

My goal, through this "labs" series of posts, is to share a few of our stories as well as our strategy for innovating from within. While imperfect, our methods provided HuffPost with new revenue, a heightened profile in the tech community, a shot at the future of media, several nifty patents, and a channel for hiring and training awesomely talented people.

I'll be writing this series over the course of the coming weeks with a few guest posts scattered within. Stay tuned for the next installment coming soon!
