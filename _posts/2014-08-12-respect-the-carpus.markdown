It's always hard to get the ol' blog started up again so I figured I'd kick things off with a short, simple, and entirely uninspired post:

New programmers. You've got the skillz. You've got the codez. You've got the jobz. But you've also got a carpal tunnel which is awfully cramped... and, uh, prone to cramping.

With all the recent (and wonderful) excitement about programming, it's important that folks remember that wrists are a delicate thing. You don't want an RSI "cramping your style" (sorry) &mdash; injuries are *much* more
common than you'd think.

The solution, luckily, is easy (and procrastinator-friendly!). Take a microbreak&mdash; 30 seconds oughta do it&mdash; every few minutes and an extended snack/healthy-life-decision break every half hour.
These breaks, coupled with a few of [these](http://cs.brown.edu/about/system/ergo/prevention/) simple suggestions, will help ensure that you'll enjoy a long and happy coding career.

Protect your wrists now and you won't regret it!

P.S. These are awesome [keyboards](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/) and great for programming.
