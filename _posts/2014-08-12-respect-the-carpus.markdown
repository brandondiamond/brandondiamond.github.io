New programmers. You've got the skills. You've got the syntax. You've even got the job. But you've also got a carpal tunnel which is awfully cramped... and, uh, prone to cramping.

With all the recent (and wonderful) excitement about programming, it's important that folks remember that wrists are a delicate thing. You don't want an RSI "cramping your style" (sorry) &mdash; injuries are *much* more
common than you'd think.

Luckily, there's an easy (and procrastinator-friendly) solution. Take a microbreak (30 seconds oughta do it) every few minutes and an extended snack/healthy-life-decision break every half hour.
These breaks, coupled with a few of [these](http://cs.brown.edu/about/system/ergo/prevention/) simple suggestions, will help ensure that you'll enjoy a long and happy coding career.

Protect your wrists now and you won't regret it!

**P.S.** These are awesome [keyboards](https://www.kinesis-ergo.com/shop/advantage-for-pc-mac/) and great for programming.
