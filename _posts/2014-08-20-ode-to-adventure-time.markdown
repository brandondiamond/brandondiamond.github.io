This is, allegedly, a technical blog&mdash; so it might seem strange for me to write about Adventure Time. And it is&hellip; but who cares.

For those allergic to cartoons, Adventure Time is an animated series on Cartoon Network created by [Pendleton Ward](http://buenothebear.com/) and ostensibly directed at children.

I say "ostensibly" mainly because I'm trying to sound smart but also because the show has a large following of non-child fans&mdash; this non-child included. While I know the idea of an elderly gentlesir watching a kids show might seem odd, Adventure Time is a bit more than just the sum of its parts. In the same way Pixar movies have something for everyone, Adventure Time keeps it silly&hellip; but also very, very real.

As a cartoon, Adventure Time isn't afraid to get dark. It's also not afraid to address some pretty serious themes including (but not limited to): death, abandonment, parenting, depression, heartbreak, lust, and yes&mdash; even [pick-up artistry](http://adventuretime.wikia.com/wiki/Jay_T._Doggzone).

What really makes Adventure Time stand out, however, isn't that it does a good job of addressing the messier parts of life&mdash; many other [movies](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102057/), [shows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocko's_Modern_Life), and books have done the [same](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oh,_the_Places_You'll_Go!). Instead, it's how it goes about it.

Set in the distant future after the earth has been devastated by nuclear apocalypse, Adventure Time tackles the harshness of reality with all the enthusiasm and imagination of a badass 14-year old. Though things get hairy from time to time, silliness, kindness, and a measure of acceptance (almost) always deliver the heroes to victory.

Rather than presenting just one edge of the sword, Adventure Time presents both: people can be cruel, depression can be crippling, and sometimes loved ones will leave us&mdash; but imagination, kindness, and positivity are great tools for moving forward.

And while part of Adventure Time's allure is its portrayal of the very best of human (and non-human) kind, the show also embraces a measure of loss, pure evil, and unavoidable suffering. That's life.

More than anything else, Adventure Time provides an unapologetically positive schematic for dealing with the harshness and occasional madness of existance via&hellip; silliness. The show reminds us that while we can't control the world we live in, we can control the way we react to it&mdash; and controlling that can make a huge difference in how we *feel*.

Homies help homies, y'know?
