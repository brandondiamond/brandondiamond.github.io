![Me, Doin' Stuff](http://i.imgur.com/FCM7jqe.jpg)

My name is Brandon and I'm a hacker. Or computer scientist. Or engineer? Or... well, I love code and community and building stuff that makes the world better&mdash; or at the very least, slightly happier.

A few years back, I co-founded [HuffPost Labs](http://code.huffingtonpost.com)&mdash; the research and development arm of the Huffington Post&mdash; where I served as it's Director and Tech Lead until 2014. The Labs crew launched a [new vertical](http://huffpost.com/code), [a](http://blogcast.fm) [whole](http://techcrunch.com/2012/08/29/huffington-post-now-has-its-own-labs-site-for-online-news-experiments/) [slew](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/31/pen-name-generator_n_5045267.html) [of](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/28/us-citizenship-test-quiz_n_5045045.html) [products](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/06/ash-wednesday-photos_n_4906188.html), and even [a few tomatoes](http://techpresident.com/news/22993/how-people-brooklyn-dual-screened-vice-presidential-debate) at the 2012 vice presidential debate. Before that, I hacked on [mongodb](http://www.mongodb.com/) as a Database Kernel Engineer and occasional evangelist.

I'm an active member of NYC's innovation community and an elected member of the [NY Tech Meetup's](http://nytm.org) Board of Directors. I produce and host a monthly segment at the NYTM called *Hack of the Month* that aims to showcase the developer community&hellip; as well as my *array* of really bad tech jokes.

In early 2009, I founded a non-profit named nyhacker that would eventually become the [Hacker Union](http://hackerunion.org/), a distributed collective of hackers, designers, and makers dedicated to supporting and expanding developer communities throughout the world.

My journey started with a particularly peppy [Quadra 660AV](http://www.myoldmac.net/webse-e-flash.htm) boasting a 28.8 Kbps connection to reality as well as a fresh install of HyperCard. After many years of geekdom, I went on to study Computer Science at Brown University where I wrote OS debugging tools and bad songs about <a href="http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs173/2005/marker-hero.mp3">PLT Scheme</a>.
